    Cherry…  
    I don’t know how to explain what you mean to me, but I’ll try.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are the most beautiful part of my world—  
    the calm in my storms,  
    the softness in my hard days,  
    the smile that appears on my face without reason.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day with you feels lighter, brighter, sweeter.  
    You make me feel understood, valued, cared for… and loved.  
    You make my heart feel safe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for holding my hand through everything.  
    Thank you for loving me the way you do.  
    Thank you for being my Cherry.
  </p>

  <p>
    With all my heart,  
    <br>
    <strong>With love, Pushpa ❤️</strong>
